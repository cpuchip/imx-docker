Development workstation installation
1. Ubuntu 22.04 preinstalled with at least 16GB RAM (recommend 32GB above) and storage device 512GB at
   least free space (recommend quicker SSD). CPU recommend Intel i7 or equivalent processor with higher
   processing speed.
2. Due to mightbe bug of Ubuntu, new created user does not join 'dialout' group, which would cause any
   serial port has no permission to access. Execute 'sudo useradd -a -G dialout <username>', then check
   by 'groups <username>' to confirm your username has listed up in dialout group.
3. If docker would be used, follow up imx-docker instruction to create docker image for use. If not,
   then please follow Dockerfile-Ubuntu-<your version> to setup require packages.

Suntek EVB porting note (based on Yocto environment)

2. Modify env.sh for 'DOCKER_WORKDIR' to your prefer location and 'MACHINE=<board name>'
3. Once you can success setup either docker or native Ubuntu environment, do following modify / add to
