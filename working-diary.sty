    1. Build success on imx-image-core / imx-image-multimedia target configuration
    2. When building imx-image-full, found bug in qtbase do_install stage
       refer to https://community.nxp.com/t5/i-MX-Processors/building-the-full-image-imx93evk/td-p/1736785
       issue resolved by add the command "chown -R root.root ${D}${libdir}" in section "do_install" in the
       recipe qtbase_git.bb, located on the path: ../sources/meta-qt6/recipes-qt/qt6

    1. Docker container with volume mount might crash and cause Mac-Pro system problem.
    2. By trying install ubuntu 22.04 under virtual machine environment, machine performace is
       greatly reduced. Also it has similiar crach issue as docker build when yocto build space
       become big.
    3. Install pure ubuntu 22.04 environment into Lenovo Legion Y7000 N/B. Partition 100GB for
       Yocto build space.
    4. During build process, it found yocto require much more space to build completely. Enlarge
       partition to 300GB and swap space enlarge from 16GB to 45GB.
